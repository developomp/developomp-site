# Contributing

## Before starting

tl;dr for dummies:

-   Suggestions and Bug reports here: [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/developomp/developomp-site/issues)
-   contribution is only for developers
-   code contributions only. No article contribution.

This document is aimed for developers. Basic level of development knowledge is expected from the contributors.
To be specific, contributors are expected to be familiar with the javascript language, react framework, code analyzers, and formatters.
If you are **not** a developer, but have suggestions and/or bugs you wish to report, feel free to do so in the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/developomp/developomp-site/issues).

## Guidelines

-   Usage of vscode is highly recommended. Other IDE are allowed as long as the code style is consistent.
-   All contributions must be made in form of a github pull request. Sending code through email or other platform is not welcomed.
-   Format code using the [prettier](https://prettier.io) formatter with [this](./.prettierrc) configuration.
-   Test your code before making a pull request.
-   Make sure to write basic comments to help other people understand your code at first glance.
-   Add a comment in the following format for each code file.

```javascript
/** filename.tsx
 *	what it does and why it exists
 */
```

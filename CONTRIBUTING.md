# Contributing

## Before starting

tl;dr for dummies:

-   Suggestions and Bug reports here: [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/developomp/developomp-site/issues)
-   contribution is only for developers
-   code contributions only. No article contribution.

This document is aimed for developers. Basic level of development knowledge is expected from contributors.
To be specific, contributors are expected to be familiar with the javascript language, react framework, and code analyzers and formatters.
If you are **not** a developer, but have suggestions and/or bug report, feel free to go to [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/developomp/developomp-site/issues).

though the code is written with multi author in mind, I won't take article contributions.

## Guidelines

-   Usage of vscode is highly recommended but other IDE works too as long as the code style is consistent.
-   All contributions must be made in form of a github pull request. Sending code through email or other platform is not welcomed.
-   Format code using Prettier formatter with [this](./.prettierrc) configuration.
-   test your code before making pull request.
-   Make sure to write basic comments to help other people understand your code at first glance.
-   file top comment

```javascript
/** filename.tsx
 *	what it does and why it exists
 */
```

We all have to constantly make small choices in our lives.
These choices include whether to study just 10 more minutes, doing just one more push-ups,
or waiting just 1 more second before getting mad at someone you care and love.
They may seem insignificant, but when put together, makes a huge difference.

Of course, even a 10 year old could tell what's the right decision to make in these situations.
However, many of us even fail to recognize the choices in the first place.

This is why I made a list of short, rememberable proverbs-like quotes so it serves as a guide not just for me but for other people too.

I wish the very best of luck to everyone who stumbled upon my blog.

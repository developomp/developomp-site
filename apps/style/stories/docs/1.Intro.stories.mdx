# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to developomp's design system!

## What is this?

This is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) of style guidelines and
reference component implementations made in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) made
primarily for websites under the [developomp.com](https://developomp.com)
domain.

## What is "developomp style"?

The developomp style is the "theme" used in my design system, and is a set of
visual elements such as colors, font styles, and spacing. These elements are
then combined appropriately to create a coherent look across my websites.

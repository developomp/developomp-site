Procrastination has got to be the single worst thing that prevents people from fulfilling their dream.
One could easily find themselves spending hours sitting on the desk with no work done.

<!-- switch from 3rd to 2nd person point of view -->

One easy way to combat this is to surround yourself with hard-working people, however, this is not always possible.
In this case, it is helpful to remind yourself that there are people (possibly your colleague, classmate, etc.) working right now as you are procrastinating.

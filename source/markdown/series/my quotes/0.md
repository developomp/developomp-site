We all have to make small choices in our lives.
They may seem insignificant, but when put together, makes a huge difference.
These choices include whether to study just 10 more minutes, doing just one more push-ups, or waiting 1 second before getting mad at someone you care and love.

Even a 10 year old could tell what's the right decision to make in these kind of situations;
however, many of us are completely oblivious to the power in our hands to make the most of our precious lives here on Earth.

This is why I made a list of quotes and published here on the internet.
I divided the lessons I've learned in my life into short, rememberable proverbs-like quote so it serves as a guide not just for me but for other people too.

I wish the very best of luck to everyone who stumbled upon this in the vast space called the internet and I hope you have a wonderful life here on earth.

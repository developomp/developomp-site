> Let's find problems in ourselves first

<div style="text-align: right"> <i>- developomp 2019</i> </div>

To fix a problem, one should first understand the problem.
If one tries to fix what is not the problem, it will make the problem worse, or make another problem.
And the first place to look for problems is not other than ourselves.
Because often times, solution to our problems turns out to be, or in ourselves.<br>

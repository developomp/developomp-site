> I don't want to call it learning that I didn't learn with my heart when I learn.

<div style="text-align: right"> <i>- developomp 2019</i> </div>

When we learn in school, we systematically memorize and recite information and immediately forget everything after an exam.
Some of us may remember some of it, but most of us don't remember most of the information we were taught.
I don't want to call that learning. Learning for me is when I know that topic of that subject by heart.
Something that you don't just get information, but the spirit of it too.
